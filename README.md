### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` in your terminal
6. Navigate to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/). App will show up in browser

## Usage
1. Enter a task in the input field and click the +. This will add the todo to the list.
2. Clicking the checkbox and trash buttons will toggle the completion status or delete the todo

## Built With
